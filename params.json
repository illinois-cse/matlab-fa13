{"name":"Matlab for Beginners","tagline":"Computational Science & Engineering â€¢ University of Illinois","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\nMATLAB is one of the most common programs used in numerical computation for engineering applications today.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the language and syntax through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nWe will use the [Etherpad](http://meetingwords.com/ehlagqUook) to share complicated snippets of code and text during class.\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\n### Monday, 11 November\r\nLicense, environment, variables, functions.\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 12 November\r\nNumerics (linear algebra and ODEs).\r\n\r\nFirst-order ODEs and systems of ODEs:  radioactive decay chains.\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 14 November\r\nCurve fitting, interpolation, publication-quality plotting.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n[CSE Handout](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa13/blob/master/lessons/handout.pdf?raw=true).  A one-page summary of common functions and expressions in MATLAB.\r\n\r\n[Cody](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody).  Mathworks' game-ified interface for learning MATLAB.\r\n\r\n[Best practices for programming MATLAB](http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2012/01/13/best-practices-for-programming-matlab/) by Mathworks Principal Developer Loran Shure.  See the comments section here as well.\r\n\r\n[Programming style guidelines](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/2529-matlab-programming-style-guidelines) by Richard Johnson.  This summary was later expanded into a book, [The Elements of MATLAB Style](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/scientific-computing-scientific-software/elements-matlab-style), reviewed [here](http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2011/02/10/book-review-the-elements-of-matlab-style/).\r\n\r\n[Clean up your code](http://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/clean-up-your-code.html).\r\n\r\n[Cornell CS 321 MATLAB Coding Standards](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs321/2003fa/Matlab%20Coding%20Style.pdf).  This outlines best practices with respect to declaring new functions and outlining what they do.\r\n\r\n_This material includes contributions from Jerry Brusher of Mathworks._\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n[Neal Davis](http://cse.illinois.edu/training) and Rishabh Narang developed these materials.
