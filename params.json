{"name":"Matlab for Beginners","tagline":"Computational Science & Engineering â€¢ University of Illinois","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\nMATLAB is one of the most common programs used in numerical computation for engineering applications today.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the language and syntax through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to programming, nor is it intended to replace courses such as CS 101 which introduce programming concepts.  We will discuss aspects of basic programming, but this course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter.\r\n\r\nExamples and applications will be of broad interest to engineers, and will attempt to exemplify good practices for general problem solving.  Our time constraints will not permit the in-depth motivation of the numerical methods selected for inclusion.  We recommend taking a numerical methods course or reading a good book on the subject if you would like the details and criteria of applicability of many of these methods.  (We warmly recommend [Acton](http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Methods-that-Work-Spectrum/dp/0883854503) or [Press _et al._](http://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688) if you are in search of a text.)\r\n\r\n## Course Notes & Exercises\r\nWe will use the [Etherpad](http://meetingwords.com/ehlagqUook) to share complicated snippets of code and text during class.  The Post-It notes are to indicate either your completion of a task (green) or your need of assistance (pink).\r\n\r\n### Monday, 11 November\r\nLicense, environment, variables, functions.\r\n\r\n[In-class exercises](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa13/blob/master/lessons/s1-examples.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 12 November\r\nNumerics (linear algebra and ODEs).\r\n\r\nFirst-order ODEs and systems of ODEs:  radioactive decay chains.\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 14 November\r\nCurve fitting, interpolation, publication-quality plotting.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n[CSE Handout](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/matlab-fa13/blob/master/lessons/handout.pdf?raw=true).
